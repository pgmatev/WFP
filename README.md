## A project for [HackTuesGG](https://www.hacktues.com)

This project uses Machine Learning to calculate the potential risk of wildfires and the direction of their spread in a chosen region on the World map. The idea is to help the firefighting agencies and organisations in preventing the disasters by providing them with a visual representation of the wildfires.

## Technologies used
* Python
* Flask
* JavaScript
* Keras
* Scikit Learn
